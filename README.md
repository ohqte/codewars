*from codewars [code of conduct](https://docs.codewars.com/community/rules/#:~:text=Be%20honorable.%20Cheating,every%20possible%20way)*:
>Be honorable. Cheating is discouraged. If you find a way to complete a kata that falls outside the kata itself (notably but not limited to: exploiting Codewars's test framework, website and servers), then refrain from doing so. Violators will be banned for such usage. Codewars has algorithms to detect some forms of cheating but does not attempt to track down every possible way.

**Kyu/Dan Ranks**

Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.

What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward.

Currently Dan level content is reserved for later. You will only find Kyu level content to train on for now.

**Earning Ranks**

You can advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above your rank - the harder the kata the faster you advance.

**Honor**

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. Honor is earned fastest through creating kata, crafting great solutions, and constructive comments.
